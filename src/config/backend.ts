/**
 * Backend Configuration
 * 
 * This file centralizes the backend server URL configuration.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: The connection type (LAN cable or WiFi) doesn't matter as long as:
 * 1. Both the server machine and client device are on the same network
 * 2. The server machine's IP address is correctly set here
 * 3. The server is running and accessible
 * 
 * To configure:
 * - Set EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL environment variable, OR
 * - Update the fallback IP address below to match your server's IP
 * 
 * To find your server's IP address:
 * - Windows: ipconfig (look for IPv4 Address)
 * - Mac/Linux: ifconfig or ip addr (look for inet address)
 * - The IP should match the network you're connected to (LAN or WiFi)
