## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

### Required Software:
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Python** (v3.8 or higher) - [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**
- **Expo CLI** (we'll install this in the setup)
- **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Required API Keys:
- **Google Gemini API Key** - [Get it here](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

## Backend Setup (Python Server)

The backend server handles OCR (text extraction), translation, and nearby places search.

### Step 1: Navigate to Backend Directory
```bash
cd backend
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` doesn't exist, install manually:
```bash
pip install flask google-generativeai requests python-dotenv
```

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder:

**Windows:**
```bash
# In the backend folder, create a file named .env
notepad .env
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# In the backend folder, create a file named .env
nano .env
```

Add the following content to the `.env` file:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
PLACES_API_KEY=your_places_api_key_here
```

**Replace:**
- `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual Google Gemini API key
- `your_places_api_key_here` with your Google Places API key (optional, but recommended)

### Step 5: Find Your Server's IP Address

You need to know your computer's IP address so the mobile app can connect to it.

**Windows:**
1. Open Command Prompt (cmd)
2. Type: `ipconfig`
3. Look for "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter (WiFi or Ethernet)
4. Copy this IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

**Mac:**
1. Open Terminal
2. Type: `ifconfig | grep "inet "`
3. Look for the IP address that starts with `192.168.` or `10.0.`
4. Copy this IP address

**Linux:**
1. Open Terminal
2. Type: `ip addr` or `ifconfig`
3. Look for the IP address under your network interface
4. Copy this IP address

**Important:** Note this IP address - you'll need it in the next section!

### Step 6: Start the Backend Server

```bash
python server.py
```

You should see:
```
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

**Keep this terminal window open!** The server must be running for the app to work.

## Frontend Setup (Mobile App)

The frontend is a React Native app built with Expo.

### Step 1: Navigate to Project Root
```bash
# If you're in the backend folder, go back to root
cd ..
```

### Step 2: Install Node Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

This may take a few minutes. Wait for it to complete.

### Step 3: Install Expo CLI (if not already installed)
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Or use npx (no installation needed):
```bash
npx expo start
```

### Step 4: Configure Backend URL

You need to tell the app where to find your backend server.

**Option A: Using Environment Variable (Recommended)**

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

**Windows:**
```bash
notepad .env
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
nano .env
```

Add this line (replace with YOUR server IP from Step 5):
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5000
```

Example:
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://192.168.1.100:5000
```

**Option B: Edit Config File Directly**

Open `src/config/backend.ts` and change the IP address:
```typescript
const BACKEND_URL = 
  process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL ?? 'http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:5000';
```

Replace `YOUR_SERVER_IP` with the IP address you found in Backend Step 5.

---

## Running the System

### Step 1: Start the Backend Server

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
cd backend
python server.py
```

Make sure it shows: `Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000`

### Step 2: Start the Frontend App

Open a **new terminal window** (keep the backend server running) and run:

```bash
# From project root
npm start
```

Or:
```bash
npx expo start
```

### Step 3: Run on Your Device

You'll see a QR code in the terminal. Choose one of these options:

**Option A: Run on Physical Device (Recommended)**
1. Install **Expo Go** app on your phone:
   - [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
   - [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
2. Make sure your phone is on the **same WiFi network** as your computer
3. Scan the QR code with:
   - **iOS**: Use the Camera app
   - **Android**: Use the Expo Go app to scan

**Option B: Run on Android Emulator**
```bash
npm run android
```

**Option C: Run on iOS Simulator (Mac only)**
```bash
npm run ios
```

**Option D: Run in Web Browser**
```bash
npm run web
```

## Configuration

### Network Connection Types

**Good news:** TravelSignAr works with **any connection type** (LAN cable or WiFi)!

**Requirements:**
- ✅ Both your computer (server) and phone (client) must be on the **same network**
- ✅ The IP address in your config must match your server's current IP
- ✅ If you switch networks, update the IP address in your config

**If you change networks:**
1. Find your new IP address (see Backend Step 5)
2. Update `.env` file or `src/config/backend.ts` with the new IP
3. Restart the Expo app

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Cannot connect to backend server"

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Make sure the backend server is running (`python server.py`)
2. ✅ Check that the IP address in your config matches your server's IP
3. ✅ Ensure both devices are on the same network
4. ✅ Check Windows Firewall - it might be blocking port 5000
   - Windows: Go to Windows Defender Firewall → Allow an app → Allow Python
5. ✅ Try pinging the server IP from your phone's network

### Problem: "GEMINI_API_KEY env var is required"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you created the `.env` file in the `backend` folder
2. Check that the file contains: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_key`
3. Restart the backend server after creating/editing `.env`

### Problem: "Expo Go can't connect to Metro bundler"

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Make sure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network
2. ✅ Try using the "Tunnel" connection type in Expo
3. ✅ Check that port 8081 is not blocked by firewall
4. ✅ Restart Expo: Press `r` in the Expo terminal to reload

### Problem: "OCR/Translation not working"

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Verify backend server is running and accessible
2. ✅ Check browser/Postman: `http://YOUR_IP:5000/translate` (should return an error, but confirms server is reachable)
3. ✅ Check backend terminal for error messages
4. ✅ Verify GEMINI_API_KEY is correct and has quota remaining

### Problem: "IP address keeps changing"

**Solution:**
- Set a static IP address on your computer, OR
- Use your computer's hostname instead of IP (if supported by your network)

### Problem: "Module not found" errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

**Windows:**
```bash
rmdir /s node_modules
npm install
```
